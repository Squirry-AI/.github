# Squirry AI  
*Your Agentic Data Companion*


##  Mission  
At Squirry-AI, our mission is to build open-source agents that simplify data accessibility while empowering developers and teams to build AI products and applications more efficiently.


##  What We Build  
We develop modular, plug-and-play AI agents designed for seamless integration into your apps and tech stack. Whether you’re building dashboards, analytics tools, or workflow automation, our agents are built to elevate your AI capabilities by making data accessible, actionable, and intelligent.


##  Key Features  
- **Open-source, plug-and-play architecture**: Easily integrate agents into your infrastructure.  
- **Tech stack**:  
  - Python  
  - FastAPI  
  - Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)  
  - Google MCP Toolbox (Model & Compute Platform toolbox)  
- **Extensible repositories**: Each repository represents a specific agent or tool, with its own `README.md`, source code, and documentation.


### Each repo’s README should include:
- **Purpose**: What this agent/tool does  
- **Tech details**: Python/FastAPI endpoints, APIs used, integration steps  
- **Installation**: Setup, dependencies, preferred environment  
- **Usage**: Code snippets, example requests and responses  
- **Contribution**: How to get involved (issues, feature requests, pull requests)  
- **License**: (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0)
